# Fireship
## [TS with React, but should you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydkQlJhodio)
* babel?
* JS vs TS
  - Silly bugs | More code
  - Selfwritten docs | Auto docs
  - Fast code now | Fast refactor later

## [Big projects are ditching TypeScript... why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ChkQKUzDCs)
* 2012 - TS released
* A few years later, Angular uses ts
* 2020s ts everywhere
* Svelte, Drizze & Turbo ditches ts
* No longer develop ts but you can still use in ts
* Not compile but pollutes with "type gymnastics"
* Using JSDoc instead for types and intellisence
* Stage 1 ECMA propostal make type native to js

## [TypeScript in 100s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQnBQ4tB3ZA)
* TS compile language, js is compilation
* `tsc` command compiles to js
